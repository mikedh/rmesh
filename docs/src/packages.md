# Packaging

`rmesh` is written in Rust and is designed for use from Rust, Python, or `wasm`. It has not been released as it is still undergoing substantial design revision, and may never be released if it doesn't work as well as hoped. It is currently building and tests are passing for all target platforms.

### Python

The project currently builds wheels for a shocking number of platforms using CIBuildWheel, and the `rmesh` PyPi project is currently reserved. 

### Rust

There is no way to reserve a crate name on [crates.io](https://crates.io), so this may be anything.

### NPM

The `@rmesh` "organization" has been reserved, and the WASM package is intended to be released to `npm add @rmesh/rmesh`
